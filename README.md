# Fenestra-Task

## Background
This case study demonstrates the use of Python for data processing and analysis using GCS with large gzipped csv files.

## Objective
The primary task is to develop Python code to perform the following actions:
1. **Data Retrieval**: Download new files from a specified Google Cloud Storage bucket.
2. **Database Operations**: Insert these files into a Cloud SQL Postgres database, involving schema creation and data insertion.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove duplicate records.
4. **Data Analysis**: Perform detailed analysis to answer specific questions related to the dataset.

## Questions Addressed
The code answers the following key questions:
- Records count per day and hour.
- Total 'EstimatedBackFillRevenue' per day and hour.
- Analysis by Buyer: records count and total 'EstimatedBackFillRevenue'.
- Unique Device Categories by Advertiser.
- Count of duplicate rows.

## Configuration Setup (`configs.py`)
- Manages essential environment variables and settings.
- Securely handles PostgreSQL database connections using externalized password management to enhance security.
- Configures Google Cloud Storage parameters, ensuring efficient and secure file handling.

## Data Processing and Ingestion (`fenestraTask.py`)
- Contains main functions for database interactions and other operations like file downloading, which intelligently avoids re-downloading files by maintaining a log.
- Implements a command generator that omits generating COPY commands for previously processed data, ensuring efficiency and idempotence.
- Includes detailed docstrings and usage examples, enhancing code readability and usability.

## Implementation and Workflow
- The results are demonstrated in a notebook (`test-package-and-docs.ipynb`) that imports both `configs.py` and `fenestraTask.py`, showcasing their functionalities.
- Passwords are securely stored in a non-committed text file and ingested using a context manager in `configs.py`.
- All project-related questions are answered through SQL queries within the notebook and an accompanying PDF.
- Due to challenges with psycopg2 and data upload, the data was eventually uploaded to the database via the terminal.
- Explored alternatives like StringIteratorIO for data uploading but opted for terminal-based methods for efficiency.
- The implementation considers scalability and routine operations, suggesting potential use of VM schedules, PubSub, HTTP triggers, and Terraform for a more automated and permission-controlled environment.
- CSVs and sensitive data are not committed to the repository for security reasons, with suggestions for using secret managers for larger scopes.
- The notebook details the removal of 5999 duplicate records and addresses schema challenges, such as converting certain numeric fields to TEXT or NUMERIC due to inconsistencies.
